# Pegasys Rideshare

A carpool-facilitating rideshare app:

* Allows users to find other people to share car rides with as a driver and/or a rider depending on which one they prefer to be on a given trip.
* Google Maps integrated for the most reliable route-matching.
* Built-in messaging functionality for coordination among users.
* User profile and trip details saved in password-protected database for optimal matching with other users (profile and trip details may be edited or deleted).

## Latest Version

The app is currently in beta and close to phase 1 deployment. Phase 2 and later deployments (expected to continue as part of MakerSquare's Legacy sprint) may add additional security layers, testing suite, design upgrades, and/or UX features not implemented in the first release candidate.

## Documentation

See [API_spec.md](https://github.com/pegasys-rideshare/pegasys/blob/master/API_spec.md) for API POST and GET routes.

Pegasys relies on the Google Maps API, as well as the [angular-google-maps
project](https://angular-ui.github.io/angular-google-maps/#!/). Note that
the angular-google-maps project is under active development, and we've 
implemented workarounds for bugs and missing features.
