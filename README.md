# Pegasys Rideshare

A carpool-facilitating rideshare app:

* Allows users to find other people to share car rides with as a driver and/or a rider depending on which one they prefer to be on a given trip.
* Google Maps integrated for the most reliable route-matching.
* Built-in messaging functionality for coordination among users.
* User profile and trip details saved in password-protected database for optimal matching with other users (profile and trip details may be edited or deleted).

## Latest Version

The app is currently in beta and close to phase 1 deployment. Phase 2 and later deployments (expected to continue as part of MakerSquare's Legacy sprint) may add additional security layers, testing suite, design upgrades, and/or UX features not implemented in the first release candidate.
